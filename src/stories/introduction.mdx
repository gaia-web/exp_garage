# Introduction

`@gaia/garage` is somewhere to put useful or not-so-useful components in case needed.

## How to install

### Install with NPM

```bash
npm i https://github.com/gaia-web/exp_garage.git
```

## How to import

### From HTML

<del>
To obtain it directly from the CDN, it can be imported by simply adding a `script` tag like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="<url>"></script>
```
</del>

If it is installed locally, then it can be imported by adding a `script` tag like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="path_to_node_modules/@gaia/garage"></script>
```

### From JavaScript

Assuming it is installed locally by using NPM, then it can be imported like this:

```js
import "@gaia/garage";
```

This `import` statement would define the custom elements automatically.

## How to use

Check the __Components__ section.
